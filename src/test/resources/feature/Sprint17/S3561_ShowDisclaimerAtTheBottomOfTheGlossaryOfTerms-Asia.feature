Feature: Show disclaimer at the bottom of the Glossary of Terms - Asia

  As a Product owner, I want to ensure that clients are displayed their localised legal documents,
  so that they understand the conditions of the service

  @S3561-AC1-AT1
  Scenario: Check whether disclaimer at the bottom of the Glossary of Terms is correct
    Given I login as type "has_account"
    When I tap on More Menu button
    And I tap on Glossary of terms
    And I slide to the bottom of the Glossary of Terms screen
    Then I should see the following message on the Glossary of Terms screen
      | element name       | element value                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
